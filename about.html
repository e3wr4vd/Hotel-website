               <p>The Rias Hotel is located in Brooklyn, in hipster Williamsburg, and we think this area is a great place to spend a fun weekend. Here you need to stay in hotels with panoramic windows and take higher rooms - the view of Manhattan is always mesmerizing. But sitting all day in a hotel and admiring the skyscrapers is not an option. You also need to walk around the area. Especially since White Avenue is not far from the hotel. Get lost in Brooklyn for at least a whole day, you still won’t get lost. The tall Rias building can be seen from almost anywhere in the area.

                The Rias rooms have three walls. The fourth is a huge panoramic window with a view of the Hudson, which has not yet left anyone indifferent.

                <p>The location is fantastic. Even though the hotel has popular bars and restaurants, my room was very quiet. One downside was there were no shelves or drawers into the room and a very small hanging space.
